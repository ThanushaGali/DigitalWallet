## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6), inspired by clarity and financial calm. A balanced hue that isn't overly assertive, but still catches the user's attention without causing anxiety.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E3F2FD), a nearly-white background that keeps the focus on content without stark contrasts.
- Accent color: Pale violet (#9575CD) to highlight interactive elements; analogous to the primary color, adding a touch of creativity and a modern sensibility. This tone complements the blue without overwhelming the user.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral, and easily readable experience.
- Use minimalist, outlined icons for clarity and a modern aesthetic.
- Clean, card-based layout for receipts to organize information clearly.
- Subtle transition animations when displaying receipt details and analytics.
